                  <p>
                    The developed web application (Daw REST API Interactive Tool) is a framework that implements a tool that interacts by text with a REST API. The following concepts will be used in the implementation: modeling vocabulary, taxonomies, thesaurus with RDF schema and SKOS and a database based on models.

                  <h3>Preliminary Considerations:</h3>
                  <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-position:inside;">
                    <li>Internal data structures/models:</li>
                   <p> 
                     The internal data is organised in models based on Sails v1.x. They represent a set of structured data, called records, and they correspond to a collection in the database. 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Actor has the following attributes: id {string}, name {string}, surname {string}, birthday {string}, movies {json}, plays {json}, foto {json}, prizes {json}. 
                          </li>
                        <li>Movie has the following attributes: id {string}, title {string}, cast {json}, isReleased {boolean}, isPlaying {boolean}, isSeries {boolean}, releasedTimestamp {string}</li>
                        <li>Review has the following attributes: id {string}, starts{number}, comment {string}, movieId {string}</li>
                        <li>User has the following attributes: emailAddress{string} (this attribute is required and unique), emailStatus{string} (default value = confirmed), emailChangeCandidate {string}, password {string} (this attribute is also required), fullName {string}(required), isSuperAdmin {boolean} (this attribute indicates if the user has extra permissions), passwordResetToken {string} (A unique token used to verify the user identity), passwordResetTokenExpiresAt {number}, emailProofToken {string}, emailProofTokenExpiresAt {number}, stripeCustomerId{string} (The id of the customer entry in Stripe associated with this user), hasBillingCard {boolean}, billingCardBrand {string}, billingCardLast4 {string}, billingCardExpMonth {string}, billingCardExpYear {string}, lastSeenAt {number}</li>
                        <p>The models are accessed from within the controller actions, helpers or tests, in this way the call model methods communicate with the database. </p>
                        </ul>
                    <li>External data sources:</li>
                   <p>Because this application is an OpenAPI schema for movies, an external data source is Internet Movie Database, IMDb which is a massive online website directory housing tons of information related to films, TV programs, video games, internet streams and more.</p>
                    <p>
                      The list of movie database APIs such as the Open Movie Database and Internet Movie 
                      Database API can be accessed at the link:

                  <h3>Application flow: </h3>
                  <p>The Proof of concept that we build exposes an OpenAPI schema for movies, similar to IMDb.com.
                    From the graphic interface the user is able to query the data using natural language.
                    The application will read the input from the user through an input text field.
                    In the backend, the input will be sent first to a syntactic and semantic module that will analyze the text and with the results from the parser the application will create a query to map user's words with the OpenApi schema as best as it can.
                    </p>
                    <p>                
                      Example of scenarios: 
                      User enters inputs like:                       
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Movie with Angelina Jolie. => extract Subject, Object and map to movies titles, movies cast or actor name.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Plays of Shakespeare. => map play to themes from OpenAPI schema like drama, movies, tragedy, theatre (query synsets from WordNet )
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Best movies from last year. => map adjectives to Reviews, to prizes won by movie, actors 
                        </li>
                    </ol> 
                    To map the words from user input to OpenApi schema we also create a dictionary of semantic terms based on OpenAPI endpoints, parameters and data models.

                                           
                </p>
              </section>
              <section>
                  <h3>Application architecture </h3>
                  <p>
                    Because this application requires a significant storage space and execution time as short as possible,  the architecture is one based on microservices and is using APIs to connect the services. In this way, the implementation is distributed and loosely coupled which leads to dynamic scalability and fault tolerance.   
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this case, the actor enters the input into the UI Service which plays the role of the client. Then the user search is processed using a Controlled Vocabulary modeled by a RDF Schema and  it is created a request to a REST API gateway which redirects the request to multiple REST APIs parallel services. Each of them is connected to a database, over which the request will be made. In the opposite way, one of the databases is sending a feedback to its REST API service then to the gateway. In the final stage, the user gets the response via UI Service. 
                  </p>
              </section>
              <section>
                  <h3>Linked Data Principles: </h3>
                  <p>In this section it will be developed how this web application incorporates the Linked Data Principles. This principles refers to URIs:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Use URIs as names for things
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.
                        </li>
                    </ol> </p>
                    
                    <p>These four rules help keeping data interconnected and they represent the unexpected re-use of information which is the value added by the web.
                      In this case, the response that the user is going to receive will consist of one or more URIs, based on how many results will be found in the database. Those  URIs will contain the URL address for a significant page for that keyword. 
                       
                    The first two rules are respected by providing the user HTTP URIs responses that respect semantic web technology. 
                    The third rule is applied by formatting every URI using RDF and the fourth rule is used if a user searches a keyword, for example an actor, he/she will receive all the links related to that actor:

                    When the user sends “john” a RDF file  will be created<http://RAT.org/john> then it will use the local identifiers within the file #smith, #Alan etc. </p>
                  <p>
                    This is how the RDF file will look like:
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                      <code class="rdf">
                    &lt;rdf:Description about="#john"&gt;
                      &lt;fam:child rdf:Resource="#smith"&gt;
                        &lt;fam:child rdf:Resource="#Alan"&gt;
                          &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>The WWW architecture is going to return a global identifier  "http://RAT.org/john#Alan" to Alan.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3>RDF - Schema</h3>
                <p>Resource Description Framework is an open standard of the W3C to describe digital resources with semantic meanings. It describes digital resources by defining and using classes and properties. The RDF Schema will help in converting the user input into a language that the REST API can process and initialize the process. It facilitates the dialogue between the client and application.
                </p>
                <p>One of the formats that defines a statement in RDF is Turtle (.ttl) that is a syntax that has abbreviations, prefixes and is easier to read for humans.  The next exemple from <a href ="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">W3</a> describes the relationship between Green Goblin and Spiderman:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="turtle">
                  @base &lt;http://example.org/&gt; .
                  @prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
                  @prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .
                  @prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;.
                  @prefix rel: &lt;http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/&gt; .
                  &lt;#green-goblin&gt;
                  rel:enemyOf &lt;#spiderman&gt; ;
                  a foaf:Person ;    # in the context of the Marvel universe
                  foaf:name "Green Goblin" .

                  &lt;#spiderman&gt;
                  rel:enemyOf &lt;#green-goblin&gt; ;
                  a foaf:Person ;
                  foaf:name "Spiderman", "Человек-паук"@ru .
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                  </p>
                <p>rdf: domain and rdf: range are used to semantically describe and derive relationships between objects. The first one declares that a property belongs to one or more classes and the second one is used to deduce that a value of an instance belongs to one or more classes. 
                  The resources in RDF are linked globally because they are identified by IRI (International Resource Identifier) which is a generalization of URL. This will help convert the response from the database in a language that the user can easily understand. The IRI can be built using a prefix. For this, we have this example from <a href ="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">W3</a>:
                  To write http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/enemyOf using the original Turtle syntax for prefixed declaration:</p>
                  <p>
                    <pre class="line-numbers">

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>The application will convert the user input using RDF Schema and will send it to a REST API gateway and therefore to multiple parallel REST APIs that will search in databases in order to achieve an answer. The response for the user request will be an IRI/URL that will provide to him the information that he/she needs. </p>
